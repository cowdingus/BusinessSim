# BusinessSim
A for-fun business strategy game.

# Building
To build the source code, one needs to have these installed:
 - CMake

and these libraries must exist and be locatable:
 - [Bromeon/Thor](https://github.com/Bromeon/Thor)
 - [fmtlib/fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt)
 - [gabime/spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)
 - [jbeder/yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp)
 - [texus/tgui (0.9.x)](https://github.com/texus/tgui)
 - [SFML/SFML (2.5)](https://github.com/SFML/SFML/)

To build it, type in these commands inside the terminal:
```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make .
```
Make sure you're on the repo's root directory.

The executable "BusinessSim" should appear if the build processes succeeded.
